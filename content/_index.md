# Hi, I'm Shuban Pal

I am currently a senior at Del Norte High School planning to pursue computer science. My favorite subjects are math and physics and I am actively trying to learn more in both fields. 

I play CTFs with Cosmic Bit Flip and I participate in FTC with my team 12499 Gear Up (mainly as a vision programmer). In the context of programming, I like to code a lot of stuff related to OS, multiphysics simulations, and CLI app development. One day I hope to use my skills in multiphysics simulation programming, computer vision, and general programming to make strides in astrophysics and space related research.
