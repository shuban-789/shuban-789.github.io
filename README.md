# Astro Starter Kit: Blog

Post tags and Markdown notes share their colors and default in [`src/tag.config.js`](src/tag.config.js).
Both support `peach`, `sky` (blue), `lavender`, `sage`, `gold`, and `rose`. Change a palette entry's
`bg`, `border`, or `text` value there to update both tags and notes.

Markdown `>` notes automatically cycle through the post's tag colors in frontmatter order. The first
note uses the first tag's color, the second note uses the second tag's color, and the sequence repeats
after the last tag. Each page starts a fresh cycle. Pages without tags use the default `sky` color.

To override the color of an individual note, put `[!color]` at the start of the quote. That note still
counts toward the cycle:

```md
> [!rose]
> NOTE: This note uses the same rose colors as a rose post tag.
>
> Notes can contain multiple paragraphs, **emphasis**, links, and lists.
```

The color marker is hidden in the rendered note. Note text uses normal weight and the surrounding body text
size, and the rounded box grows to fit its content.

```sh
npm create astro@latest -- --template blog
```

## 🚀 Project Structure

Inside of your Astro project, you'll see the following folders and files:

```text
├── public/
├── src/
│   ├── assets/
│   ├── components/
│   ├── content/
│   ├── layouts/
│   └── pages/
├── astro.config.mjs
├── README.md
├── package.json
└── tsconfig.json
```

Astro looks for `.astro` or `.md` files in the `src/pages/` directory. Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name.

There's nothing special about `src/components/`, but that's where we like to put any Astro/React/Vue/Svelte/Preact components.

The `src/content/` directory contains "collections" of related Markdown and MDX documents. Use `getCollection()` to retrieve posts from `src/content/blog/`, and type-check your frontmatter using an optional schema. See [Astro's Content Collections docs](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/content-collections/) to learn more.

Any static assets, like images, can be placed in the `public/` directory.

## 🧞 Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:
